Title: Shared Parameter Model for Missing EHR Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rebecca Anthopolos
Maintainer: Rebecca Anthopolos <anthopolos@gmail.com>
Description: This package fits a Bayesian shared parameter model to handle missing data in multiple longitudinal health outcomes collected in electronic health records (EHRs). Missing data in EHRs are generated by a patient-led visit process and a response process for longitudinal health outcomes given a clinic visit. As big data, longitudinal health outcomes in EHRs may be naturally heterogeneous. The shared parameter model exploits this heterogeneity in EHR patient populations by using growth mixture models as sub-models for the longitudinal health outcomes, visit process, and response process given a clinic visit. To account for missing data mechanisms that may be missing not at random, the longitudinal health outcomes, visit process, and response process given a clinic visit are linked via a discrete latent class parameter for a patient's latent class membership.
    The model targets longitudinal health outcomes that are collected according to a clinically prescribed visit schedule, such that the visit process is defined in discrete time. Longitudinal health outcomes are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. The package permits conducting sensitivity analysis assuming missing data mechanisms that are missing at random or using only observed data.
